# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

During the app building process, it was easy until the last step for image URL to be display on the simulator iphone. At first, I thought it was the problem with my own code, however, I could not find the problem I got, it just told me there is no match, Then I googled and I change the URL "http" tp "https" and problem solved!
